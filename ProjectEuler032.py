#Project Euler, Problem 32
#Pandigital products

"""We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use 
of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 
15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, 
containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity 
can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be 
sure to only include it once in your sum.
